DataStax Brisk
==============

Brisk was an early prototype of [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org) and [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org) integration.  It has been superceded by [DataStax Enterprise](http://www.datastax.com/what-we-offer/products-services/datastax-enterprise).  DataStax Enterprise adds [Solr integration](http://www.datastax.com/what-we-offer/products-services/datastax-enterprise/apache-solr), [security features](http://www.datastax.com/resources/whitepapers/whats-new-in-dse3), performance enhancements, and many bug fixes.  

Brisk has not been updated since 2011 and will not be updated in the future.  The code here is provided for historical purposes only.  It is not suitable for production use.
